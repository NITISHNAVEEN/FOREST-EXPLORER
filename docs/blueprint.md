# **App Name**: Forest Explorer

## Core Features:

- Role-Based Random Forest: Generates a simplified visualization of a Random Forest algorithm tailored for three roles: doctor, a FSSAI certification manager, and a bank manager. Each role sees a different level of detail in the visualization, and uses animations and pictures for easy story telling while explaining random forest.
- Interactive Visualization: Allows users to interact with the visualization to explore decision boundaries and feature importance. For example, the user can hover to get the feature importance displayed, or drag an example across a decision boundary.
- Step-by-Step Explanation: Provides a step-by-step explanation of how the Random Forest algorithm makes predictions, adapting the explanation to the selected role's knowledge level using a tool that synthesizes knowledge from a large corpus of ML explanations.
- Example Data Sets: Includes a library of pre-loaded datasets that can be used to demonstrate the Random Forest algorithm.
- Custom Data Upload: Enables users to upload their own data to train and visualize the Random Forest algorithm.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Royal Blue to convey trust and understanding of complex concepts.
- Background color: Light grey (#F5F5F5) to keep the interface clean and focused on the visualizations.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) to highlight interactive elements and key insights.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for a clean, modern, and approachable look.
- Use clear and intuitive icons to represent different features and data elements.
- The layout will adapt to different screen sizes, with a sidebar for settings and data selection.
- Subtle animations for data updates and interactions to improve user engagement.
- Animations and pictures for easy story telling while explaining random forest to different roles.
